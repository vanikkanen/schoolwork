This first part is the generic explanation on how the game works
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program is a memory game. The games objective is to fiind all the pairs of
cards on the board.

The program starts the user at the menu window where the user can choose how
many players and pairs of cards there will be in the game. The game will then
start with the given parameters when the start button is pressed. There is also
a close button that shuts the program down. Also in the menu is a text browser
that shows the results of the last 30 player scores. The players score is only
saved and showed if the player got more than 0 pairs in the game. There is a
maximum amount of 5 players and 26 pairs and minimum amount of 1 player and 2
pairs that the game can be ran with. Both of these can be affected with the
spinbox components.

When the start button is clicked a new window with the game components. Here
there are a grid of buttons representing the cards and player name boxes and
players card packs. There is also a button to return to the menu window and
to close the whole program. There is also a text label that tells whose turn it
is. If a pair is found the turn stays on the player who found the pair.

You can turn the card by clicking on it. Only 2 cards can be turned at a time.
After the second card is turned it is checked and then either turned or removed
from the board, depending if the turned cards were a pair or not. If the cards
turned were a pair the label is updated to show that a pair was found by what
player and the card is added to the players card pack. After this the cards are
removed from the board and turn kept on the player. After all the cards are
found the game announces the winner or winners if a tie. It saves the scores to
a file and returns to the menu window.

The player names can be updated at any time during the game but they start with
generic "PlayerX" names. After the name is updated it is updated on the label
if it is that players turn at the moment.

This part will explain all the extra functionalities of the game project
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The added functionalities will be listed by the number they were shown in Plussa

1. Pelissä on vaihteleva määrä pelaajia, ja pelaajien määrä kysytään
   käyttäjältä. Pelaajat voi nimetä esim. Pelaaja1, Pelaaja2 jne.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   There is a dynamic amount of players in the game. The player amount can be
   between 1 and 5 players.

2. Käyttäjä voi antaa pelaajille myös nimet
   -------------------------------------------
   The players can be named whenever during the game by editing the text in the
   players LineEdit box. This name will be saved in the games scoreboard at the
   end of the game.

3. Pelitilanne esitetään graafisesti
   ----------------------------------
   The pairs found are added graphically to the players card pack. This card
   pack shows all the cards the player has found during the game. If the player
   founds multiple pairs and they dont fit in the card pack it can be scrolled
   to the side with either with mouse wheel scroll to the right and left or
   the arrow keys.

4. Sen lisäksi, että kerrotaan, kuinka monta korttia/paria kukin pelaaja on
   saanut, kerrotaan myös, mitkä kortit kukin pelaaja on saanut.
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The same card pack element shows all the cards the player has found. The
   card image is added to the top of the card pack when the player founds the
   pair. The found pairs can be counted from the card pack element or they are
   told in the scoreboard in the menu after the game if any pairs were found.

6. Pelin päätyttyä (tai muutenkin) peliasetelman voi palauttaa alkutilanteeseen,
   jolloin käyttäjä voi aloittaa uuden pelin käynnistämättä ohjelmaa uudelleen.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The game can be resetted at any time by clicking the menu button. This will
   take the user back to the menu window from where a new game with new settings
   can be started.

7. Peli sisältää tulostaulun, johon tallentuu pelaajan saamat pisteet.
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   The game saves all the players scores to teh scoreboard. The scoreboard only
   saves the last 30 players scores to ease the size of the scoreboard. The
   scoreboard also saves the newest games score to the top of the scoreboard.

8. Korttien taustapuolella on kuva (kaikissa korteissa samanlainen).
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   There is a card back image on all the cards. This changes to another image
   when the card is turned.

9. Kirjainten sijasta korttien kuvapuolella on oikea kuva.
   ----------------------------------------------------------
   There is a real card image on all the cards on the game board. That shows
   when the card is turned and shown in the players card back if found.
